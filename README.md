# Immaculate-Grid-SQL
SQL queries for playing Baseball Reference's Immaculate Grid game

My work to try and create successful SQL queries using the Lahman Baseball Database to answer questions for Baseball Reference's Immaculate Grid.
Should be noted that the Lahman Baseball Database, as of this moment, only has records through 2024 so the query results will not always match what is showing on Immaculate Grid.
